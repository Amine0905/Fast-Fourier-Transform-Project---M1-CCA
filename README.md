# Fast Fourier Transform Project

This project implements a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in three different versions: sequential, parallelized with OpenMP, and distributed with MPI.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

- `OMP`: Contains the OpenMP parallelized version of the FFT algorithm.
- `Serial`: Contains the sequential version of the FFT algorithm.
- `MPI`: Contains the MPI distributed version of the FFT algorithm.

Each directory includes its own `Makefile` for compilation and execution.
